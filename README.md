**Google Data Analytics Certification Capstone Project: Cyclistic Bike-Share**

## Introduction
In 2016, Cyclistic, a fictional bike-sharing company launched a successful bike-share program that has since grown to a fleet of 5,824 bicycles, geotracked and locked into a network of 692 stations across Chicago. The bikes can be unlocked from one station and returned to any other station in the system anytime. Cyclistic offers flexible pricing plans: single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships. Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as casual riders, while customers with annual memberships are Cyclistic members.

Objective:
The primary objective of this project is to analyze how annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently. Understanding these differences will help design targeted marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members, aligning with Cyclistic's goal of maximizing profitability through increased membership. For this, the marketing analyst team wants to know:
 1. How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?
 2. Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships?
 3. How can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to become members?
I am positioned as a junior data analyst and will address the first question using the 6 steps of data analysis: How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?

## PREPARE

The data utilized in this project is hosted on [Amazon Web Services (AWS)](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html). For this analysis, I am using trip data spanning 6 months, from June 2023 to November 2023. This dataset, provided directly by Cyclistic, has been made available by Motivate International Inc. under the [license](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html). The data has been anonymized to ensure privacy, excluding any personally identifiable information. While this limits the ability to analyze specific personal attributes, such as individual rider histories or residential areas, there is ample data available to identify overall usage patterns and behaviors.

## PROCESS
The primary tool used for the analysis is R
